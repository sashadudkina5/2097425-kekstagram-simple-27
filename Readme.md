# Kekstagram

Kekstagram is a web-based photo editing and sharing application developed as a personal study project. This project was  based on the repository [https://github.com/htmlacademy-javascript/2097425-kekstagram-simple-27](https://github.com/htmlacademy-javascript/2097425-kekstagram-simple-27). HTML and CSS foundations were provided, while all JavaScript functionalities were implemented independently. The main focus during the study process was on JavaScript, particularly on DOM manipulations and working with event listeners.

## Overview

Kekstagram offers a platform for editing and sharing photos online. Users can leverage features such as filters, scaling down images, commenting, and sharing to the server.

## Features

- **Filter Application**: Apply a variety of filters, with the option to adjust filter intensity.
- **Scaling Down**: Resize images. (Please note that scaling up an image is technically impossible as the backend server doesn't accept zoomed-in photos.)
- **Error Handling**: Handling network errors.
- **Comment Section**: Implemented with Pristine to control minimum and maximum comment length.
- **Server Sharing**: Sharing is implemented with Fetch API and validated with Pristine.

## Technologies Used

- **noUiSlider**: Utilized for implementing intuitive slider controls to adjust filter intensity.
- **Pristine**: Integrated for form validation to ensure data integrity and enhance user input experience.
- **Fetch API**: Employed for making asynchronous HTTP requests to fetch and share data with the server.
